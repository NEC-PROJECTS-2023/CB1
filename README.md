### INTRODUCTION
Deep learning is a recent evolution of artificial intelligence that has gained considerable attention. The idea of neural networks has been around for a long time, but significantly better performance has now been achieved in various research areas from handwriting recognition, number classification through to face detection. The ability to handle more complex problems is limited however. Until recently, most researchers believed that computer vision system and models needed to be carefully hand-designed with comprehensive analysis to capture the characteristics of the desired tasks for the problem at hand. The AlexNet[3] neural network model showed outstanding performance in the 2012 ImageNet[4] benchmark compared with existing state of the art computer vision approaches. More recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been viewed as the mainstream approach for solving graphics-related problems and a multitude of more complex and diverse CNNs now exist. The rapid development of CNNs and availability of significant computing power provides the opportunity to solve more complicated image processing problems. One challenge is for detection of objects in an image with a high degree of accuracy and speed. The Region proposal method based on Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN)[5] provides improved performance over other vision analysis techniques however the requirement for extremely high computing power makes them less ubiquitous and hence under-utilized. Improved methods and post-processing of feature maps are offered by. In this project, we describe a model that implements the Faster RCNN technique to achieve normal object detection and an associated CNN based on transfer learning for dog breed classification. The rest of the project focuses on the analysis of the Faster RCNN model and the associated models like InceptionResNetV2[6], NASNetLarge[7], Xception[8], InceptionV3[9]. We describe the process of hyperparameter tuning and model suitability analysis. The accuracy and performance of the model are presented. The mobile realization is introduced, including the model transformation and underlying communication model. Finally, the drawbacks and limitations of the model are presented and areas of the future work identified.
